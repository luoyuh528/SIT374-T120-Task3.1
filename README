This is the git repository for a git assessment task for SIT764 students in
Trimester 2, 2019. The idea is that you initially fork this repository into
your personal space (on the server), and then clone it to your local machine.

In the workshops in Week 3, Trimester 2, we will go through the details.

If you have any questions about the usage of this repository, please contact
the Unit Chair Prof. Jean-Guy Schneider <jeanguy.schneider@deakin.edu.au>
